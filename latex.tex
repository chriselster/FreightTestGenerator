\subsection{Instance Generator}
\label{sec:instance-generator}



We created a simple instance generator that can be used to make test cases with a specific amount of items.
It is guaranteed by a greedy heuristic that the instance is feasible, that is, that there is a configuration of items and vehicles
that satisfy the problem constraints. The greedy heuristic works as follows: the items are generated with random weights
and for each of them a random customer is determined. Finally the vehicles needed to transport all the items are generated,
considering that some items can be transported together.

Using this instance generator we created a set of test cases with 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 items. For each of these test cases
we've run the BRKGA using three different decoders wich are described in the next section.
